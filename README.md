# Overview

This project, landing-page, is a part of The Odin Project curriculum. The goal is to build a responsive landing page that demonstrates fundamental web development skills, including the use of Flexbox for layout, proper alignment of elements, embedding URLs, inserting images, and creating a clean, organized general layout.

# Skills Demonstrated





Flexbox Usage: Utilizes CSS Flexbox to create a responsive and flexible layout for the landing page.

Alignments: Ensures proper alignment of text, images, and other elements using CSS properties like justify-content, align-items, and margins/padding.

URLs: Includes functional hyperlinks to external resources or sections within the page.

Image Insertions: Embeds images correctly with appropriate alt text for accessibility.

General Layout Format: Follows a structured layout with a header, main content sections, and a footer, ensuring a visually appealing design.

# Project Structure


index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the landing page.

styles.css: The CSS file with all styling, including Flexbox and alignment rules.

images/: A directory containing all images used in the project.

README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.

# Setup Instructions


Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory:

cd landing-page

Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to view the landing page:

open index.html

Alternatively, you can use a local development server (e.g., with VS Code's Live Server extension) for a better experience.

# Usage

The landing page includes a header with navigation links, a hero section with a call-to-action, a content section with images and text, and a footer.

Test the responsiveness by resizing the browser window to see Flexbox in action.

Click on the navigation links to ensure they redirect correctly (some may point to external URLs or sections within the page).

Verify that images load correctly and have appropriate alt text.
